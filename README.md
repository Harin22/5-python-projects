# 5 Python Projects in 5 Days

## **What** is this?
This is a collection of **5 beginner Python projects**. Last week, I challenged myself to get out of a coding rut by creating a *new Python project every single day*. The purpose of this exercise was to show how versatile Python can be, especially for beginners, to create vastly different projects without spending too much time. ‚è∞

## **How** does it work?
Every day by 7AM PST, I will be adding a new project to [this repository](https://github.com/harshibar/5-python-projects) in the following categories:
1. [Game Development (Flappy Bird ft. Yogi)](https://github.com/harshibar/5-python-projects/tree/master/1_game)
2. [Machine Learning (Teaching an AI to play Ping Pong)](https://github.com/harshibar/5-python-projects/tree/master/2_ml)
3. Web Development
4. Data Visualization
5. Scripting

Each project folder will include the code itself, usage instructions, and additional resources. I'll also be uploading a corresponding video on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/harshibar); each 4-6 minute video will show what inspired the project and its basic building blocks. üì∫

## **Why** does this exist?
Eve since I was learning how to code and starting my career in tech, one piece of advice I often heard (and now give) is to *create* as much as possible -- through independent projects, hackathons, etc. To this day, whenever I sit down wanting to start a new project, my mind goes blank. I always ask myself, ***but what do I make?*** ü§î

I must not be the only one facing this 'idea-block.' So, I wanted to create a beginner-friendly collection of Python projects that are accessible, fun to learn, and easy to clone and expand. üëå

## **Who** created this?
That would be me -- Harshi! I am a recent college graduate and spent a year working at a Silicon Valley startup before quitting to launch *my own* startup. Meanwhile, I've been launching my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/harshibar), where I create content about [tech](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgxIjxced6Mdo5zbmmcKTbNEcjVolPkFS), [career](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgxIjxced6Mdam-S5yYKluBlJfFv16VEr), [productivity](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgxIjxced6MdG_w2pKxBiYsBj6ubLxDiT), and [lifestyle](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgxIjxced6Mc3yGhCQmF9hkxtjPKYYKZj). üë©üèæ‚Äçüíª

## **When** was this made?
This project was release the week of May 18, 2020. üìÖ
