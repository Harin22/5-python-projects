# 5 Python Projects in 5 Days

## **What** is this?
This is a collection of **5 beginner Python projects**. Last week, I challenged myself to get out of a coding rut by creating a *new Python project every single day*. Of course, there are some limitations to this -- I can't perfect every line of code, I may need to take some inspiration from GitHub, and there will be significant room for improvement. But, the purpose of this exercise was to show how versatile Python can be, especially for beginners, to create such different projects, even without spending too much time. ‚åöÔ∏è

## **How** does it work?
Every day from 5/18/2020 to 5/22/2020, I will be adding a new project to this repo in:
    1. Game Development
    2. Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence
    3. Web Development
    4. Data Visualization
    5. Scripting

That week, every day by 7AM PST, I will be adding a new project to this repository. To correspond with the project, I'll be uploading a new video on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/harshibar). Each 4-6 minute video will guide the viewer on what inspired the project and its basic building blocks, with more thorough code found in the appropriate folder [here](https://github.com/harshibar/5-python-projects)! üóÇ

## **Why** does this exist?
Since I was learning how to code and starting my career in tech, one piece I often heard (and now give) is to *create* as much as possible -- through independent projects, hackathons, etc. To this day, whenever I sit down wanting to start a new project, my mind goes blank. ***But what do I make?*** ü§î

I must not be the only one facing this 'idea-block.' So, I wanted to create a beginner-friendly consortium collection of Python projects that are accessible, fun to learn, and easy to clone and expand. üëå

## **Who** created this?
That would be me -- Harshi! I am a recent college graduate, and spent a year working at a Silicon Valley biotech startup before quitting to launch *my own* education startup. Meanwhile, I've also been launching my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/harshibar), where I create content about [tech](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgxIjxced6Mdo5zbmmcKTbNEcjVolPkFS), [career](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgxIjxced6Mdam-S5yYKluBlJfFv16VEr), [productivity](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgxIjxced6MdG_w2pKxBiYsBj6ubLxDiT), and [lifestyle](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgxIjxced6Mc3yGhCQmF9hkxtjPKYYKZj). üì∫

## **When** was this made?
This project was release the week of May 18, 2020. üìÖ
